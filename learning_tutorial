# PHP Basics (Theory)
1. PHP Syntax
- PHP code is written inside `<?php ... ?>` tags.  
- It can be embedded within HTML to create dynamic web pages.  
- PHP scripts are executed on the server, and the result is sent to the browser.

2. Variables
- Variables are used to store data and are defined with the `$` symbol.  
- They are loosely typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare their type.

3. Constants
- Constants are immutable and defined using the `define()` function or the `const` keyword.  
- Constants are global and can be accessed anywhere in the script.

4. Conditional Statements
- Used to make decisions based on conditions (`if`, `else`, `elseif`, `switch`).

5. Loops
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`) are used for iterating through data or performing repetitive tasks.

# Functions in PHP
1. Function Creation and Calling
- Functions encapsulate reusable blocks of code.  
- They are defined using the `function` keyword and can accept arguments.

2. Default Arguments
- Functions can have default values for arguments that are optional during function calls.

3. Passing Arguments by Reference
- You can pass variables by reference using the `&` symbol, allowing the function to modify the original variable.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP
1. Classes and Objects
- A class is a blueprint for objects and contains properties and methods.  
- Objects are instances of a class.

2. Inheritance
- Allows a class to inherit methods and properties from another class.  
- Supports the concept of code reuse and hierarchy.

3. Access Modifiers
- Control the visibility of properties and methods:
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
  - `protected`: Accessible within the class and its descendants.
  - `private`: Accessible only within the class.

4. Static Methods and Properties
- Declared using the `static` keyword.  
- Can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

# Arrays in PHP
1. Types of Arrays
- Indexed Arrays: Store elements with numeric keys.  
- Associative Arrays: Use string keys for elements.  
- Multidimensional Arrays: Arrays containing other arrays.

2. Array Methods
- PHP offers functions to manipulate arrays, like sorting, merging, and searching.  
- Examples: `sort()`, `array_merge()`, `in_array()`, `array_push()`, and `count()`.

# Strings in PHP

1. String Basics
- Strings are sequences of characters.  
- PHP provides functions to manipulate strings, such as concatenation, searching, and formatting.

2. String Methods
- Common string operations include calculating length, replacing substrings, and splitting/joining strings.  
- Examples: `strlen()`, `str_replace()`, `substr()`, and `implode()`.
